# Meow-i-sizer

The meow keyboard is served without warranty as always if it breaks your computer thats on you chuuuumpuh.

Otherwise, you need python 3 and the current pip verisons of tkinter and pynput

## Use

launch the application and then whenever you type you'll hear meows, that's all there is too it, you don't have to have the window in focus or anything

## Replacing files

if you want to have something other than meows you can edit line 23
